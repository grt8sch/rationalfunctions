      <p>
        When the slider of variable a changes value, the vertical asymptote of the x value moves with it linearly. The variable a increasing causes shift left, and the variable a decreasing causes shift right.
      </p>
      <p>The maximum and minimum number of asymptotes stays at one for a.</p>
      <p>
        When 0&lt;a&lt;1 or a &lt; 1, a still behaves normally.

      <p>
        When the slider of variable b increases value, the two vertical asymptotes get closer until they are greater than zero which causes the vertical asymptotes to not be real.  When b decreases, the vertical asymptotes get farther apart from each other.  The variable b increasing causes the asymptotes to compress inwards until they are imaginary, and the variable b decreasing causes the asymptotes to stretch away from each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        When b &lt; 0, there are two vertical asymptotes. When b = 0, there is one  vertical asymptote. When b &lt; 0, there are no vertical asymptotes.
      </p>
      <p>
        When 0&lt;b&lt;1, the graph is like a hump that slowly gets smaller the greater value b is. When b is smaller than zero, there is no hump and two asymptotes.

      <p>
        The graph gets bigger when a is farther away from zero and causes the x value moves negatively to a.
      </p>
      <p>
        The number of vertical and horizontal asymptotes stays at 1. This is the minimum and maximum asymptotes.
      </p>

        When each individual variable becomes between 0 and 1 or smaller than 1, each variable still behaves normally.

      <p>
        In the graph, when b gets closer to a, the graph gets smaller.
        When |b-a| in the graph increases, the vertical and horizontal stretch of the graph increase.
      </p>
      <p>
        The number of vertical and horizontal asymptotes stays at 1. This is the minimum and maximum asymptotes.

      <p>
        When a is changed, the slant horizontal asymptote slope changes correspondingly. When a is changed the left and right side separate vertically, and the graph increases in size.
When b is changed, the slant horizontal asymptote y intercept changes. The graph also gets bigger. The graph also gets bigger at the same time.
When c is changed, the slant horizontal asymptote slope changes correspondingly. When a is changed the left and right side get closer together, and the graph decreases in size.
When b is changed, the slant horizontal asymptote y intercept changes. The graph also gets smaller. The graph also gets bigger at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a is increased, the slant horizontal asymptote slope increases. When a is decreased, the slant horizontal asymptote slope decreased. When a is increases or decreases, the graph stretches vertically and compresses horizontally.
When b is increased, the graph translates up. When b is decreased, the graph is translated down. The graph stretches vertically when b is increased or decreased.
When c is increased, the slant horizontal asymptote slope increases. When c is decreased, the slant horizontal asymptote slope decreased. When c gets closer to 1, the graph is vertically compressed and horizontally stretched.
When d is increased, the graph translates up. When d is decreased, the graph translates down. The graph stretches vertically and horizontally when b is increased or decreased.
      </p>
      <p>
        For both graphs, the number of vertical and horizontal asymptotes stays at 1. This is the minimum and maximum asymptotes.
        When each individual variable becomes smaller than 1, each variable still behaves normally. When a is between 0 and 1 the graph horizontally stretches.  When b is between 0 and 1, the graph is vertically and horizontally compressed. When c is between 0 and 1, the graph is vertically stretched. When d is between 0 and 1, the left the graph is horizontally stretched.
